### The Shell
- In Erlang, you can test most of your stuff in an emulator; it will run your scripts when compiled and deployed, but it will also let you edit stuff live. To start the shell in Linux, open a terminal and then type in `$ erl`

### Shell Commands
- First of all, if you type some text and then go ^A (Ctrl+A), you should see your cursor moving to the beginning of the line. ^E (Ctrl+E) gets you to the end. You can use arrow keys to go forward, backwards, show previous or next lines so you can repeat code.
- If you type something like li and then press "tab", the shell will have completed the terms for you to lists:. Press tab again, and the shell will suggest you many functions to use after
- `help().` to get help
- `q().` to quit
